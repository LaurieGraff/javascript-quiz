## project notes
    This week continued to be a challenge.  JavaScript is starting to make sense, but it is very slow coming for me.  I feel as though I had a good start with the array and the setup of the questions, but obviously there are elements missing from the acceptance criteria.  I made an attempt at the timer and have some ideas as to how to make it work.  I got hung up at the point of moving from one question to the next and how to tie in correct/incorrect answers to the appropriate questions.  There is also some CSS styling that could be refined.
